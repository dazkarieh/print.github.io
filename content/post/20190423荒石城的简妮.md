中世纪的童谣还是挺多的，《荒石城的简妮》（《Jenny of Old stones》）
<!--more-->

{{ quote ta="center" }}

High in the halls of the kings who are gone.高堂之上，国王不再
Jenny would dance with her ghosts.简妮会跟鬼魂翩翩起舞
The ones she had lost and the ones she had found.有她失去的那些和她寻到的那些
And the ones who had loved her the most.还有最爱她的那些
The ones who’d been gone for so very long遗失已久的那些
She couldn’t remember their names她记不起他们的名字
They spun her around on the damp cold stone他们在潮湿的古石边围着她转
Spun away all her sorrow and pain转走了她所有的悲伤和痛苦
And she never wanted to leave她从未想过要离开
Never wanted to leave永远不想离开......
