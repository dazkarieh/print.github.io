这首歌的简体中文版应该是莫文蔚的《你给我多少时间》，事实证明，天下大同，地球人所谓失恋的感觉原本大同小异。好好先生想太多，成全大局的角色　讨好永远坎坷。

{{< quote bar="true" size="17px"  ta="center" from="Delays《Lover's Spit》">}}

Slow, slow me down, <br>
Slow, slow me down.<br>
Grown a map about my eyes,<br>
You speak slowly, I can only shake<br>
This port town could fit the bill<br>
But you have got the keys;<br>
You have got the pills<br>
I’ve been drifting, almost sleeping deep,<br>
There really is no mystery,<br>
We got this hour so why not use it…
