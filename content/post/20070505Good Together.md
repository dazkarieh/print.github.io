{{< quote bar="true" size="17px"  ta="center" from="Littl'ans 《We Look Good Together》 ">}}

No to the people - they kiss alike<br>
no to the people - they touch alike<br>
we look too good together<br>
good together<br>
and i never never never<br>
no i never never never<br><br>

there'll be another time i tell myself<br>
when i pass across again and you'll tell yourself<br><br>

we look too good together<br>
good together<br>
and i never know<br>
would i ever know<br>
by my self<br>
well is this love<br>
i dont know myself<br><br>

time has told me<br>
i'm not the only one<br>
you..<br>
i'll never know<br>
time has told me<br><br>

its the sun inside of me more than anybody else i have ever known<br>
first taste like freedom, the last's just like the grieve<br><br>

we look good together<br>
good together<br>
and i never never never<br>
but i ever ever ever let you go oh!<br>
from my heart<br>
from my heart<br>
from my heart<br>

there'll be another time i tell myself<br>
when i pass across again and you'll tell yourself<br><br>

wohoo..<br><br>

there'll be another time i tell myself<br>
when i pass across again and you'll tell yourself<br>
because its love<br>
is this love<br>
or is its love, well i know myself<br><br>

i went to chelsea to get some money<br>
i went to world's end to get a friend<br>
i met a goth<br>
said i wanted to change its style<br>
said i'd been into black for a while<br><br>

went to soho for a place to stay<br>
ended up in a parking lot<br>
well i was taken there for a ride<br>
i was taking for everything i got<br><br>

lalala da da ...<br><br>
