怪那天到访，吃过你一颗软糖。

Please don't flow so fast<br>
You little mountain hum<br>
I'll take a bottle down to you<br><br>

Please don't flow this fast<br>
You hold a little hum<br>
I'll bottow sounds of me for you<br><br>

Please don't flow so fast<br>
You little mountain din<br>
I'll bottow piano sounds from you<br>

Please don't flow so fast<br>
You little mountain noise<br>
I'll close my eyes and bite your　tongue<br>
