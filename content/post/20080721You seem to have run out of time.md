{{< quote bar="true" size="17.5px"  ta="center" from="Windermere《Trailer Park》">}}
So you say, that you've lost it<br>
You're acting out reality<br>
The mask you wear it seems so true, at times<br>
The burned out end of the trailer park<br><br>

Reach out your hands to touch the sky<br>
The morning comes with all it's lies<br>
You seem to cry<br>
You seem to have run out of time<br>
You can't get by<br>
You've given up wondering why<br>
Singing, is that all that life brings<br>
And then<br><br>

You gave it all, you look for more<br>
You're dreaming of a thousand rooms<br>
You wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh<br>
The world is here in the trailer park<br><br>

Reach out your hands to touch the sky<br>
The morning comes with all it's lies<br>
You seem to cry You seem to have run out of time<br>
You can't get by<br>
You've given up wondering why<br>
Singing, is that all that life brings to me?<br>
